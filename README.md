## My process
1. Design was carefully analyzed
2. HMTL elements were created
3. Container elements were placed as viewed from the design
4. Worked on the style sheet from top to bottom of the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Continued development

For future development, I plan on working practcing more basic HTML and CSS while integrating my new knowledge on CSS Flexbox and Grid
